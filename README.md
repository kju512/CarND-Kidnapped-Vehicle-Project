# CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project
This is a Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program completed by Michael chen.This program implements a particle_filter filter for localization.


## Build and Run
1. clone this repository to your local machine.
2. implement below order step by step.  
> ./clean.sh  
> ./build.sh  
> ./run.sh  
3. open the the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).and Select "the Project 3:Kidnapped Vehicle",then click the button "start".After about fourty seconds running, You will get successfull message like that "Success! Your particle filter passed!"


## file instruction
The directory structure of this repository is as follows:

```
root
|   build.sh
|   clean.sh
|   CMakeLists.txt
|   README.md
|   run.sh
|
|___data
|   |   
|   |   map_data.txt
|

|___src
    |   helper_functions.h
    |   main.cpp
    |   map.h
    |   particle_filter.cpp
    |   particle_filter.h
```


## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

### All other data the simulator provides, such as observations and controls.
