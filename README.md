# CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project
This is a Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program completed by Michael chen.This program implements a particle_filter filter for localization.


## Build and Run
1.clone this repository to your local machine.
2.implement below order step by step.
> ./clean.sh
> ./build.sh
> ./run.sh


#### runing output
the output should see something like the following output:
.
.
.
Time step: 2443
Cumulative mean weighted error: x 0.11339 y 0.109573 yaw 0.00375831
Runtime (sec): 12.9204
Success! Your particle filter passed!

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.


#### Control Data
`control_data.txt` contains rows of control data. Each row corresponds to the control data for the corresponding time step. The two columns represent
1. vehicle speed (in meters per second)
2. vehicle yaw rate (in radians per second)

#### Observation Data
The `observation` directory includes around 2000 files. Each file is numbered according to the timestep in which that observation takes place. 

These files contain observation data for all "observable" landmarks. Here observable means the landmark is sufficiently close to the vehicle. Each row in these files corresponds to a single landmark. The two columns represent:
1. x distance to the landmark in meters (right is positive) RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE. 
2. y distance to the landmark in meters (forward is positive) RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE.
